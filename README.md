The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980's.
I developed this version of Pomodoro technique using the ``Java`` programming language and more specifically through the use of ``JavaFX``.
``JavaFX`` is the ultimate way to build Graphical User Interfaces in ``Java``.  It is robust and customizable.

- **Using Layout Panes**
- **Styling Panes using CSS**
